/**
 * {@link Fight} is central gameplay part of a whole game. In {@link Fight}s {@link Leader}s put their {@link Minion}s
 * to the test for life and death. Concept is a little similar to the Pok√©mon series because {@link Minion}s are not
 * directly controlled and {@link Leader} can influence their actions by modifying their decks of {@link Card}s.
 *<p>
 *  In this version first {@link Leader} is controlled by a player and second one is controlled by the game. Only
 *  player have {@link Special} abilities, and he has to use them to win a {@link Fight}. The greatest power of
 *  player {@link Leader} is ability to steal {@link Card}s from his enemy {@link Minion}s and pass them to their {@link Minion}s.
 *  <p>
 * Round consist of two phases. In first phase, called a turn, both leaders spend their {@link Leader#getEnergy}
 * to use their {@link Special}s until they decide to pass a turn.
 * <p>
 * In second phase first {@link Team} clears the block and its {@link Minion}s play their {@link Card}s, then
 * second {@link Team} block is cleared, and they play their {@link Card}s.
 * <p>
 * Now next round starts by {@link Minion}s drawing their new {@link Card}s and shuffling their decks if needed. {@link Fight} lasts
 * until all {@link Minion}s of one {@link Team} are slayed.
